`use_cache=True` is incompatible with gradient checkpointing. Setting `use_cache=False`.
c:\Users\krish\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python312\Lib\site-packages\torch\_dynamo\eval_frame.py:745: UserWarning: torch.utils.checkpoint: the use_reentrant parameter should be passed explicitly. In version 2.5 we will raise an exception if use_reentrant is not passed. use_reentrant=False is recommended, but if you need to preserve the current default behavior, you can pass use_reentrant=True. Refer to docs for more details on the differences between the two variants.

c:\Users\krish\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python312\Lib\site-packages\huggingface_hub\file_download.py:140: UserWarning: `huggingface_hub` cache-system uses symlinks by default to efficiently store duplicated files but your machine does not support them in C:\Users\krish\.cache\huggingface\hub\models--PES1UG22CS292--llama3.2-chessaibot. Caching files will still work but in a degraded version that might require more space on your disk. This warning can be disabled by setting the `HF_HUB_DISABLE_SYMLINKS_WARNING` environment variable. For more details, see https://huggingface.co/docs/huggingface_hub/how-to-cache#limitations.
To support symlinks on Windows, you either need to activate Developer Mode or to run Python as an administrator. In order to activate developer mode, see this article: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/get-started/enable-your-device-for-development
